# CreditMetrics
A simplified CreditMetrics model using Monte Carlo simulation. 
For documentation and full guide, please read [Simplified CreditMetrics Model by Using Monte Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/jamesckcc/CreditMetrics/blob/main/Simplified%20CreditMetrics%20Model%20by%20Using%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.pdf) from above.

Working environment:
•	Macro must be enabled in the Excel file.
•	The Excel file BondPortfolio.xlsm and the Python program main.py must be in the same folder.
•	Python version 3.7 or higher must be installed. The following Python libraries must be installed: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, and openpyxl. 

The Excel file is essentially the UI of the program, you don't have to open other files to run the program. To run the program, open BondPortfolio.xlsm after setting up the environment:

•	Create the Portfolio in <Portfolio>
•	Initiate and fill in the correlation matrix in <Correlation>
•	Select the Number of Simulation and click "Execute Program" in <Run Program>
